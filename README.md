### Built with

### What I learned

By creating this project I've learned to use flexbox and grid properly and also learned how to position a element in the proper way.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log("Hello World");
};
```

### Useful resources

- [W3schools](https://www.w3schools.com) - This helped me for understanding overflow property for this project. I really liked the way they provide the content.
